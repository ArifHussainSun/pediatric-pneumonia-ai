Model Improvement Recommendations
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
----------------------------------------
LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS:
----------------------------------------
1. Data Collection:
   - Collect more examples similar to high-severity edge cases
   - Focus on underrepresented image quality types

2. Model Architecture:
   - Consider attention mechanisms for better feature focus
   - Evaluate ensemble methods for improved reliability

3. Training Improvements:
   - Use hard negative mining for difficult cases
   - Implement focal loss for handling class imbalance
   - Add regularization for overconfidence

4. Preprocessing Enhancements:
   - Implement adaptive CLAHE based on image characteristics
   - Add more sophisticated quality assessment
   - Consider multi-scale preprocessing approaches
